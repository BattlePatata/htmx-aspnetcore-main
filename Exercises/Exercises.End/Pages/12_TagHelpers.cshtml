    # 12. ASP.NET Core Tag Helpers

    During your journey through the different samples, you've likely noticed the use of `Url.Page` to generate links to each Razor page. While the approach works, it can be noisy and tedious. Instead, you can use the tag helpers found in **Htmx.TagHelpers** to generate links to any ASP.NET Core endpoint. HTMX.NET models the tag helpers after the `asp-` tag helpers found in ASP.NET Core so that you can create links to endpoints, MVC actions, and Razor Pages. Let's look at an example.

    ```
    hx-get
    hx-page="12_TagHelpers"
    hx-target="#target"
    ```

    In this case, you need to specify the HTTP method version of the `hx` attribute, and then you can use `hx-page` to point to our Razor Page. Using these tag helpers can help you keep our Razor views clean and concise.
